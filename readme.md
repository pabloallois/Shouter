Hello ,
The task for you is very simple. What I want you to do is something very similiar to Twitter. I want you to create MVC 3 Razor web application with MongoDB database as the backing store. You can get a C# driver from MongoDB’s site to add as reference in your project. You can use any one of following approaches ... code first, database first or model first. You’re encouraged to use jQuery as an aid for any Javascript on the client side and for UI please use the Bootstrap framework.
Sign In screen – This will be the entry point for the application. User should enter his email address to get access to the application. Please use regex validation for filtering the bad input.
Main Screen – This will be the main screen for the application. User should be able to post any message and the message will appear in the list below the input box. Messages will be sorted from latest to oldest. The posts should contain email address, message content (escape HTML) and how long ago was the message posted (in a human friendly fashion, such as „3 seconds ago.“). The screen should work asynchronously using Ajax calls. Email address should be mailto link. In the top right corner there should be logout button to dismiss the current session.

Good luck,
Looking forward for your solution.
